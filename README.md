This is my personal website. 
I used pre-made template TemplateMo 560 Astro Motion (https://templatemo.com/tm-560-astro-motion) 
While googling and researching JS, HTML & CSS i am slowly changing things around the website and that helps me prepare for my next courses in SoftUni - JS, HTML & CSS 
Next step is to make the 'Download Resume' button active. And fix the 'Send email' form
